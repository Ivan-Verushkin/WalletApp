# WalletApp
It is a test task intended for me to create REST API project to retrieve all user available data by userId.
# Technologies used
I used .Net 7.0, C# 11, PostgreSQL, EntityFrameworkCore, Asp.Net Core Web API and Swagger for this project.
# Project setup
1. The project includes migrations for a database. To run the changes open Package Manager Console and write "update-database"
2. The project has seed data that will populate the tables in the database once you run the project
